# AOC-23
Couldn't land on a language for AOC this year. Been a long year and have worked with so many new languages this year.
I decided that I would try to do each day in a different language.

## Randomizer (randomizer.py) if you want to join me
```bash
python randomizer.py
```


## Day 1
### Mojo

## Day 2
### C++ (dear god why)

## Day 3
