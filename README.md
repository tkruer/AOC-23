# ðŸŽ„ AOC-23 ðŸŽ„
Couldn't land on a language for AOC this year. Been a long year and have worked with so many new languages this year. I decided that I would try to do each day in a different language (this was a mistake).

If you want to suffer like me you can run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tkruer/AOC-23 
cd AOC-23 
python randomizer.py
```
This will return a random language to work on for the day. Feel free to edit any of them. The script is nothing advanced.

## Day 1 - Mojo
- Not bad, would do it again

## Day 2 - C++ 
- dear god why

## Day 3 - Rust
- LFG 

## Day 4 - Zig
  I didn't finish the second part lol

## Day 5 - Cuda
  I'm excited for this, hopefully it's not too bad

## Day 6 - Bash
  I'm already going to hate this 

## Day 7 - Ruby
  I wish I didn't even put this on the list
